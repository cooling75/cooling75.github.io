# Using hacker theme with Github pages

***

Using the hacker remote theme in github pages took me some minutes. In case you have already some posts available in your repository just save them somewhere else and delete the complete folder. The hacker theme uses a single markdown file __index.md__ in the root of the repo. You can link to new blog entries with:

```
[link name](link to file)
```

## Blog entries

[Arduino-cli and VSCode](./blog/arduino.md)  
[Test to restore backups](./blog/restore.md)  
[Use kubectl without 'sudo'](./blog/k3sWithoutSudo.md)
